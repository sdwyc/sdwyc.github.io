  title={Transformer-based Traversability Analysis for Autonomous Navigation in Outdoor Environments with Water Hazard},
  author={Xu, Mingrui and Wang, Yinchuan and Zhang, Xiang and Mao, Donghui and Wang, Chaoqun and Song, Rui and Li, Yibin},
  abstract={Traversability analysis is of vital importance for autonomous vehicle navigation in outdoor environments. This paper focuses on the navigation algorithms in outdoor environments with water hazards, where the water areas can neither simply be neglected nor be deemed as non-traversable for safe and efficient navigation. To this end, we present a tightly-integrated navigation algorithms framework, which includes an environmental traversability analysis model and a control signal acquisition model. The traversability analysis model includes the SwinT-CGRU semantic segmentation model and the ConvCRFs water analysis model proposed in this paper. SwinT-CGRU can efficiently extract the feature from the input successive images, providing initial analysis of environmental traversability. To further analyze the water region, we employ a ConvCRFs, which determines the water traversability in an effective way. The results of the water traversability analysis are convincing for reliable vehicle navigation in outdoor scenarios. Based on the traversability analysis results, we propose a path planning approach by adapting the artificial potential field method to the image space. The control signal for steering and driving the vehicle can be acquired through an established mapping from the image space to the vehicle space. Experiments demonstrate that our segmentation model improves mIoU by 2.09-18.21\% on the RELLIS-3D dataset. Furthermore, our navigation algorithm exhibits real-time performance and stability, ensuring the safety of vehicles in outdoor environments.},

  title={History-Aware Planning for Risk-free Autonomous Navigation on Unknown Uneven Terrain},
  author={Wang, Yinchuan and Du, Nianfei and Qin, Yongsen and Zhang, Xiang and Song, Rui and Wang, Chaoqun},
  abstract={It is challenging for the mobile robot to achieve autonomous and mapless navigation in the unknown environment with uneven terrain. In this study, we present a layered and systematic pipeline. At the local level, we maintain a tree structure that is dynamically extended with the navigation. This structure unifies the planning with the terrain identification. Besides, it contributes to explicitly identifying the hazardous areas on uneven terrain. In particular, certain nodes of the tree are consistently kept to form a sparse graph at the global level, which records the history of the exploration. A series of subgoals that can be obtained in the tree and the graph are utilized for leading the navigation. To determine a subgoal, we develop an evaluation method whose input elements can be efficiently obtained on the layered structure. We conduct both simulation and real-world experiments to evaluate the developed method and its key modules. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. The robot can travel through the unknown uneven region safely and reach the target rapidly without a preconstructed map.},

  title={A Comfortable Interaction Strategy for the Visually Impaired Using Quadruped Guidance Robot},
  abstract={A guidance robot that can guide its user to the destination smoothly and comfortably without rigorous training is expected to bring more convenience to the visually impaired. Although guidance robots have evolved considerably, little attention has been paid to the importance of human-robot interaction in the guidance process which will bring an unpleasant experience for the user when the amplitude of the interaction force increases. In this paper, we propose an interaction strategy for the visually impaired using quadruped guidance robot based on compliance control to make the user more comfortable to be guided. The user can track robot's trajectory by perceiving the variation of traction force or manipulate the movement of the robot by applying force to the robot using proposed strategy. We also build a quadruped guidance robot system with an autonomous navigation algorithm. The robot can plan a safe path that ensures the user does not collide with obstacles when following the robot. Then the robot continuously interacts with its user while following the planned path to the goal to provide a comfortable experience. Experiments show that the interaction strategy we deployed in our quadruped guidance robot reduces traction force during guidance and improves the user experience.},

  title={Autonomous battery-changing system for UAV's lifelong flight},
  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) lifelong flight is essential to accomplish various tasks, e.g., aerial patrol, aerial rescue, etc. However, traditional UAVs have limited power to sustain their flight and need skilled operators manually control their charging process. Manufacturers and users are eagerly seeking a reliable autonomous battery-changing solution. To address this need, we propose and design an autonomous battery-changing system for UAVs using the theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ) and user-centered design (UCD) methods. For practical application, we employ UCD to thoroughly analyze user requirements, identify multiple pairs of technical contradictions, and solve these inconsistencies using TRIZ theory. Furthermore, we design an autonomous battery-changing hardware system that meets user requirements and realizes the battery change process after the automatic landing of UAVs. Finally, we conduct experiments to validate our system's effectiveness. The experimental results show that our battery-changing system can implement the autonomous battery-changing task, and our system has high efficiency and robustness in the real environment.},

  title={Low-drift LiDAR-only Odometry and Mapping for UGVs in Environments with Non-level Roads},
  abstract={This study focuses on localization and mapping for UGVs when they are deployed in environments with non-level roads. In these scenarios, the vehicles need to travel through flat but not necessarily level grounds, i.e., ascent or descent, which may cause drifts of the robot pose and distortion of the map. We develop a low-drift LiDAR odometry and mapping approach for the UGV with LiDAR as the only exteroceptive sensor. A factor-graph based pose optimization method is developed with a specifically designed factor named slope factor. This factor includes the slope information that is estimated from a real-time LiDAR data stream. The slope information is also used to enhance the loop-closure detection procedure. Moreover, an incremental pitch estimation mechanism is designed to achieve further pose estimation refinement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed framework in real-world environments. The odometry drift is lower and the map is more precise than experiments with the state-of-the-arts. Notably, on the Kitti dataset, our method also exhibits convincing performance, demonstrating its strength in more general application scenarios.},

  author={Wang, Yinchuan and Xu, Mingrui and Chen, Xiangyu and Zhang, Xiang and Wang, Chaoqun and Song, Rui},
  abstract={Autonomous exploration is the prerequisite for reliable robot navigation in unknown environments via providing the necessary information. The goal is to build a precise environment map while at the same time locating the robot robustly. To achieve this goal, this paper develops an information map that jointly provides the information of mapping and localization uncertainty. It consists of a localization uncertainty map and a model uncertainty map. The former evaluates the landmarks around the robot and the latter indicates the map completeness based on information theory. The information map serves as the input for making better decisions of where-to-go to achieve higher localization and mapping performance. To improve the efficiency of information map prediction, we develop a learning-based map prediction framework, where a dataset is established autonomously. The effectiveness and efficiency of the developed framework are verified through experiments in simulation environments.},
